            // Exercise IV:
            // Make a JavaScript program to calculate the hours, minutes and seconds based on an entered number (seconds) in prompt. (i.e. 3663)
            // In the starter files in HTML for this exercise, you will notice a blank <h1> inside the body already sitting there. (do not delete this one, you will need it.)
            // Get and save the number coming from prompt (the seconds)
            // Make a calculation and get the appropriate time for the hours, minutes and seconds.
            // Select the <h1> element from the body.
            // Add a text with JavaScript to the <h1> element saying: “The time is hours:minutes:seconds” based on the calculation from above (i.e “The time is 1h:1min:3sec.”).
            // Underline the text of the <h1> and center it horizontally with JavaScript. 
            // (text-decoration: underline; text-align: center;)
            // Do not use CSS for the styling.
